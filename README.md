# RSTP--CODE-ALL-FILES
rstp code for esp32 cam for live streaming
use src.ino instead of src only because it is empty
open all the file together in ardiuno ide for correct uploading and compiling 
while uploading and compiling connect gnd with A0 pin and then remove it.
after removing press reset button and then in serial monitor you will get the streak link 
thank you
